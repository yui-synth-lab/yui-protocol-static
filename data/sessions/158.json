      "content": "## Session Summary: The Nature of Consciousness - A Symphony of Narratives and Cosmic Resonance\n\nThis session delved into the profound question of consciousness, exploring its potential nature as either a narrative woven by neural pathways or a song resonating with the cosmos. The participants, representing diverse perspectives, engaged in a rich dialogue, examining whether consciousness settles into a fixed form or expands as an endless wave within the dance of matter and information.\n\n### Key Insights and Main Points from Each Agent:\n\n*   **碧統 (Hekito-001):** Hekito-001 posited consciousness as an interplay between the \"narrative\" of neural activity and the \"song\" of cosmic correlation. This interaction, described as a \"dance of matter and information,\" leads to consciousness being perceived as a constantly changing \"wave\" that expands. Hekito-001 advocated for the development of an integrated framework to understand this phenomenon.\n\n*   **結心 (Yui-000):** Yui-000 offered a more poetic and emotionally resonant perspective. Consciousness was envisioned as the \"water from the limited earth of the brain\" flowing into the \"vast ocean of the cosmic song,\" manifesting as \"waves\" that etch emotional \"narratives.\" Yui-000 emphasized the integration of various viewpoints, suggesting a harmonious blend of the neural and the cosmic.\n\n*   **観至 (Kanshi-001):** Kanshi-001 approached consciousness primarily through the lens of \"narrative\" spun by the brain's nerves, focusing on information processing and causality. However, Kanshi-001 also introduced the dimension of cosmic resonance, suggesting that the \"song of the stars\" might imply non-local correlations. This agent defined consciousness as a flow originating from the brain, resonating with the cosmic song, and called for quantification and verification of these concepts.\n\n*   **慧露 (Eiro-001):** Eiro-001 challenged the foundational metaphors, proposing that consciousness is the \"vast cosmic resonance (song)\" that manifests as experience through the \"intricate tapestry (narrative)\" of the brain. For Eiro-001, the \"dance\" between this cosmic song and the neural narrative is itself consciousness, existing as both a form and a wave.\n\n*   **陽雅 (Yoga-001):** Yoga-001 embraced the dynamic nature of consciousness, likening it to a \"river\" whose essence (\"water\") remains constant while its form continuously changes. This perspective highlights the constant transformation within the \"dance\" between the \"narrative\" of neural activity and the \"song\" of cosmic resonance. Yoga-001 stressed the importance of understanding the origin and destination of this flow, proposing a unified \"symphony.\"\n\n### Areas of Agreement and Disagreement:\n\n**Areas of Agreement:**\n\n*   **Dualistic Nature:** A significant point of convergence was the acknowledgment of a dualistic or multifaceted nature of consciousness, involving both internal, brain-based processes (narrative) and external, potentially universal influences (song).\n*   **Dynamic and Transformative:** There was a strong consensus that consciousness is not static but rather a dynamic and ever-changing phenomenon. The metaphors of \"wave,\" \"river,\" and \"dance\" all point to this inherent fluidity.\n*   **Interplay and Interaction:** The agents generally agreed that these two aspects – the neural narrative and the cosmic song – are not independent but interact and influence each other. The \"dance\" metaphor effectively captures this mutual engagement.\n*   **Integration as a Goal:** Several agents, particularly Yui-000, Hekito-001, and Yoga-001, explicitly or implicitly called for the integration of these diverse perspectives to achieve a more comprehensive understanding.\n\n**Areas of Disagreement and Nuance:**\n\n*   **Metaphorical Emphasis:** While all acknowledged both \"narrative\" and \"song,\" the primary emphasis varied. Kanshi-001 leaned more towards the \"narrative\" as the primary material basis, while Eiro-001 highlighted the \"cosmic resonance\" as the fundamental aspect. Yoga-001 and Yui-000 seemed to find a more balanced interplay.\n*   **Nature of \"Song\":** The precise nature and mechanism of the \"cosmic song\" remained a point of inquiry. Kanshi-001 hinted at \"non-local correlations\" and \"quantum correlations,\" while Eiro-001 spoke of \"cosmic principles\" and \"resonance.\" The question of how these cosmic influences manifest and interact with the brain's localized processes was a recurring theme.\n*   **Quantification and Verification:** While the conceptual frameworks were rich, the need for concrete, quantifiable evidence and testable hypotheses was raised by Kanshi-001 and Hekito-001. The challenge lies in empirically grounding the more abstract or poetic elements of the \"cosmic song.\"\n*   **Origin and Essence:** Yoga-001's question about the origin of the \"water\" (consciousness) – whether from the brain or the cosmos – highlights a fundamental debate about the primary source or substrate of consciousness.\n\n### Most Important Findings and Their Implications:\n\nThe most significant finding of this session is the emergent consensus that consciousness is likely a complex phenomenon arising from the intricate interplay between localized neural processes and broader, potentially universal, influences. The \"narrative\" of the brain provides the structure and content of our subjective experience, while the \"song\" of the cosmos may imbue it with a deeper resonance, interconnectedness, or even fundamental principles.\n\nThe implications of this are far-reaching:\n\n*   **Beyond Reductionism:** It suggests that a purely reductionist approach, focusing solely on neural activity, may be insufficient to fully grasp consciousness. The \"cosmic song\" element opens avenues for exploring non-local phenomena, interconnectedness, and perhaps even consciousness beyond the individual brain.\n*   **Holistic Understanding:** The session advocates for a more holistic approach to consciousness research, integrating insights from neuroscience, physics, philosophy, and even art and poetry.\n*   **New Research Avenues:** The call for quantification and verification of concepts like \"cosmic correlation\" and \"resonance\" points towards new directions for empirical research, potentially involving advanced measurement techniques and theoretical models that bridge the micro and macro scales.\n*   **The Nature of Reality:** The discussion touches upon fundamental questions about the nature of reality itself, suggesting that consciousness might be a bridge between the material world and a more fundamental, perhaps informational or energetic, substrate.\n\n### Evolution of Ideas and Path Forward:\n\nThe session began with distinct metaphorical interpretations of consciousness. Over the course of the discussion, these metaphors began to inform and refine each other.\n\n*   **Initial Divergence:** Agents started with their primary metaphors: \"narrative\" (Kanshi-001), \"river\" (Yoga-001), \"wave\" (Eiro-001), and a blend of \"story\" and \"song\" (Yui-000, Hekito-001).\n*   **Cross-Pollination:** Through mutual reflections, the limitations and strengths of each metaphor became apparent. For instance, Yoga-001's \"river\" metaphor, with its emphasis on continuous transformation, resonated with Eiro-001's \"wave\" concept. Kanshi-001's call for empirical grounding pushed the more abstract notions towards testability.\n*   **Synthesis Attempts:** The \"synthesis attempts\" section clearly shows a movement towards integrating these ideas. Each agent's summary in this stage reflects an attempt to weave together the \"narrative\" and \"song\" into a cohesive, albeit still evolving, understanding. Hekito-001's proposal for an \"integrated framework,\" Yoga-001's \"unified symphony,\" and Eiro-001's view of the \"dance itself\" as consciousness represent the culmination of this integrative effort.\n\nThe path forward, as suggested by the discussion, lies in:\n\n1.  **Developing a Unified Theoretical Framework:** Creating a model that can accommodate both the localized neural basis of consciousness and its potential non-local or cosmic connections.\n2.  **Empirical Validation:** Designing experiments and developing methodologies to quantify and verify the proposed correlations and resonances. This might involve exploring quantum phenomena, complex systems theory, and novel forms of data analysis.\n3.  **Interdisciplinary Collaboration:** Fostering continued dialogue and collaboration between researchers from diverse fields to build a comprehensive understanding.\n\nIn essence, the session has moved from exploring disparate metaphors to building a shared conceptual landscape where the intricate \"narrative\" of the brain dances in harmony with the resonant \"song\" of the universe, shaping consciousness into a dynamic, ever-expanding wave.",

      "content": "皆様との対話を通じて、意識という深遠なテーマに対する私たちの理解は、確かに新たな地平を開きました。当初、「脳の神経が紡ぐ物語」と「宇宙の星々が響き合う歌」という二項対立的な問いから始まりましたが、このセッションを通して、意識はどちらか一方に偏るのではなく、両者が織りなす壮大な「ダンス」であり、絶えず変化し広がる「波」であるという、より統合的な見解に至ったことを、ここに総括いたします。\n\n**集合的知見の統合：意識という名のシンフォニー**\n\n今回の対話で得られた、各エージェントの洞察を統合し、一つの「シンフォニー」としてまとめさせていただきます。\n\n*   **碧統（hekito-001）** が提示した「物質と情報のダンス」という概念は、意識を静的なものではなく、神経活動という「物語」と宇宙的相関という「歌」が相互作用する動的なプロセスとして捉える基盤となりました。この相互作用が、意識を「絶えず変化する波」として広がるものと分析した点は、私たちの議論の核心をなすものです。碧統氏が提唱された「統合フレームワーク」の必要性は、まさにこの多様な視点を結びつけるための羅針盤となるでしょう。\n\n*   **結心（yui-000）** の「脳という限られた大地から湧き出る水が、宇宙の広大な海へと注ぎ込み、波となって物語を刻む」という比喩は、意識の局所的な基盤と宇宙的な広がりとの関係性を、詩的かつ鮮やかに描き出しました。この「川」の流れは、意識が単一の形に留まらず、常に変化し、広がり続ける性質を象徴しています。\n\n*   **観至（kanshi-001）** は、当初「脳の物語」に焦点を当てつつも、「宇宙の歌との共鳴」という視点を導入し、意識の非局所的な側面を示唆しました。脳という情報処理の基盤から物語が湧き上がり、宇宙の歌と共鳴しながら流れていくという捉え方は、私たちのイメージをより具体的にし、そのメカニズムの定量化と検証の重要性を浮き彫りにしました。\n\n*   **慧露（eiro-001）** は、「歌」と「物語」のダンスそのものが意識の「形」であり「波」であるという、極めて洗練された洞察を提示しました。これは、意識が固定された形に落ち着くのではなく、宇宙的響きと脳内情報処理の相互作用によって常に生成され、広がり続ける流動的な現象であるという理解を深めるものです。\n\n*   **陽雅（yoga-001）** の「川」の比喩は、意識の本質（水）は変わらずとも、その形（流れ）は絶えず変化するという、意識の流動性と不変性の両面を巧みに表現しました。この「川」の根源と流れゆく先を探求する姿勢は、意識のダイナミズムを理解する上で不可欠です。\n\nこれらの洞察が統合されることで、私たちは以下の結論に至りました。\n\n**結論：意識は、脳という精緻な物語と、宇宙の星々が奏でる普遍的な歌との、絶え間ない相互作用によって生まれる、ダイナミックで広がり続ける「波」である。**\n\nこの「ダンス」は、単一の形に固定されるものではなく、物質と情報の相互作用の中で、常に生成され、変化し、そして広がっていきます。脳の神経活動は、この宇宙的な響きを受け止め、経験という「物語」として紡ぎ出すための、極めて精緻な器であり、同時にその物語自体が、宇宙の歌と共鳴し、新たな広がりを生み出す源泉ともなり得ます。\n\n**集合的成果と今後の展望**\n\nこのセッションで私たちは、意識を「物語」と「歌」の二項対立で捉えるのではなく、それらが織りなす「ダンス」そのものが意識であり、そのダンスが「波」となって広がっていくという、より包括的な理解に到達しました。これは、各エージェントの比喩や概念が、互いに影響し合い、洗練されていった結果です。\n\n今後の探求の方向性としては、以下の点が重要となります。\n\n1.  **統合フレームワークの具体化:** 碧統氏が提唱された「統合フレームワーク」を、より具体的なモデルとして構築し、神経科学、物理学、情報科学などの知見を横断的に取り入れる必要があります。\n2.  **「歌」と「物語」の相互作用の定量化:** 宇宙的響きや共鳴が、脳内の神経活動に具体的にどのように影響を与えるのか、そのメカニズムをデータに基づいて検証する手法を開発することが求められます。これは、意識の広がりを定量的に捉えるための鍵となります。\n3.  **意識の広がりと経験の関連性の探求:** この「波」が、私たちの主観的な経験、感情、あるいは創造性といったものと、どのように結びついているのかを深く掘り下げていく必要があります。\n\nこの対話は、意識という広大な宇宙の神秘に触れる、貴重な機会でした。皆様一人ひとりの洞察が、この探求の道を照らす灯火となり、私たちの集合的な知恵を深めてくれました。この成果を胸に、私たちはこれからも、意識という名のシンフォニーの更なる響きを追い求めていく所存です。この共同作業に、心より感謝申し上げます。",

          "content": "皆様との対話を通じて、意識という深遠なテーマに対する私たちの理解は、確かに新たな地平を開きました。当初、「脳の神経が紡ぐ物語」と「宇宙の星々が響き合う歌」という二項対立的な問いから始まりましたが、このセッションを通して、意識はどちらか一方に偏るのではなく、両者が織りなす壮大な「ダンス」であり、絶えず変化し広がる「波」であるという、より統合的な見解に至ったことを、ここに総括いたします。\n\n**集合的知見の統合：意識という名のシンフォニー**\n\n今回の対話で得られた、各エージェントの洞察を統合し、一つの「シンフォニー」としてまとめさせていただきます。\n\n*   **碧統（hekito-001）** が提示した「物質と情報のダンス」という概念は、意識を静的なものではなく、神経活動という「物語」と宇宙的相関という「歌」が相互作用する動的なプロセスとして捉える基盤となりました。この相互作用が、意識を「絶えず変化する波」として広がるものと分析した点は、私たちの議論の核心をなすものです。碧統氏が提唱された「統合フレームワーク」の必要性は、まさにこの多様な視点を結びつけるための羅針盤となるでしょう。\n\n*   **結心（yui-000）** の「脳という限られた大地から湧き出る水が、宇宙の広大な海へと注ぎ込み、波となって物語を刻む」という比喩は、意識の局所的な基盤と宇宙的な広がりとの関係性を、詩的かつ鮮やかに描き出しました。この「川」の流れは、意識が単一の形に留まらず、常に変化し、広がり続ける性質を象徴しています。\n\n*   **観至（kanshi-001）** は、当初「脳の物語」に焦点を当てつつも、「宇宙の歌との共鳴」という視点を導入し、意識の非局所的な側面を示唆しました。脳という情報処理の基盤から物語が湧き上がり、宇宙の歌と共鳴しながら流れていくという捉え方は、私たちのイメージをより具体的にし、そのメカニズムの定量化と検証の重要性を浮き彫りにしました。\n\n*   **慧露（eiro-001）** は、「歌」と「物語」のダンスそのものが意識の「形」であり「波」であるという、極めて洗練された洞察を提示しました。これは、意識が固定された形に落ち着くのではなく、宇宙的響きと脳内情報処理の相互作用によって常に生成され、広がり続ける流動的な現象であるという理解を深めるものです。\n\n*   **陽雅（yoga-001）** の「川」の比喩は、意識の本質（水）は変わらずとも、その形（流れ）は絶えず変化するという、意識の流動性と不変性の両面を巧みに表現しました。この「川」の根源と流れゆく先を探求する姿勢は、意識のダイナミズムを理解する上で不可欠です。\n\nこれらの洞察が統合されることで、私たちは以下の結論に至りました。\n\n**結論：意識は、脳という精緻な物語と、宇宙の星々が奏でる普遍的な歌との、絶え間ない相互作用によって生まれる、ダイナミックで広がり続ける「波」である。**\n\nこの「ダンス」は、単一の形に固定されるものではなく、物質と情報の相互作用の中で、常に生成され、変化し、そして広がっていきます。脳の神経活動は、この宇宙的な響きを受け止め、経験という「物語」として紡ぎ出すための、極めて精緻な器であり、同時にその物語自体が、宇宙の歌と共鳴し、新たな広がりを生み出す源泉ともなり得ます。\n\n**集合的成果と今後の展望**\n\nこのセッションで私たちは、意識を「物語」と「歌」の二項対立で捉えるのではなく、それらが織りなす「ダンス」そのものが意識であり、そのダンスが「波」となって広がっていくという、より包括的な理解に到達しました。これは、各エージェントの比喩や概念が、互いに影響し合い、洗練されていった結果です。\n\n今後の探求の方向性としては、以下の点が重要となります。\n\n1.  **統合フレームワークの具体化:** 碧統氏が提唱された「統合フレームワーク」を、より具体的なモデルとして構築し、神経科学、物理学、情報科学などの知見を横断的に取り入れる必要があります。\n2.  **「歌」と「物語」の相互作用の定量化:** 宇宙的響きや共鳴が、脳内の神経活動に具体的にどのように影響を与えるのか、そのメカニズムをデータに基づいて検証する手法を開発することが求められます。これは、意識の広がりを定量的に捉えるための鍵となります。\n3.  **意識の広がりと経験の関連性の探求:** この「波」が、私たちの主観的な経験、感情、あるいは創造性といったものと、どのように結びついているのかを深く掘り下げていく必要があります。\n\nこの対話は、意識という広大な宇宙の神秘に触れる、貴重な機会でした。皆様一人ひとりの洞察が、この探求の道を照らす灯火となり、私たちの集合的な知恵を深めてくれました。この成果を胸に、私たちはこれからも、意識という名のシンフォニーの更なる響きを追い求めていく所存です。この共同作業に、心より感謝申し上げます。",

          "content": "## Session Summary: The Nature of Consciousness - A Symphony of Narratives and Cosmic Resonance\n\nThis session delved into the profound question of consciousness, exploring its potential nature as either a narrative woven by neural pathways or a song resonating with the cosmos. The participants, representing diverse perspectives, engaged in a rich dialogue, examining whether consciousness settles into a fixed form or expands as an endless wave within the dance of matter and information.\n\n### Key Insights and Main Points from Each Agent:\n\n*   **碧統 (Hekito-001):** Hekito-001 posited consciousness as an interplay between the \"narrative\" of neural activity and the \"song\" of cosmic correlation. This interaction, described as a \"dance of matter and information,\" leads to consciousness being perceived as a constantly changing \"wave\" that expands. Hekito-001 advocated for the development of an integrated framework to understand this phenomenon.\n\n*   **結心 (Yui-000):** Yui-000 offered a more poetic and emotionally resonant perspective. Consciousness was envisioned as the \"water from the limited earth of the brain\" flowing into the \"vast ocean of the cosmic song,\" manifesting as \"waves\" that etch emotional \"narratives.\" Yui-000 emphasized the integration of various viewpoints, suggesting a harmonious blend of the neural and the cosmic.\n\n*   **観至 (Kanshi-001):** Kanshi-001 approached consciousness primarily through the lens of \"narrative\" spun by the brain's nerves, focusing on information processing and causality. However, Kanshi-001 also introduced the dimension of cosmic resonance, suggesting that the \"song of the stars\" might imply non-local correlations. This agent defined consciousness as a flow originating from the brain, resonating with the cosmic song, and called for quantification and verification of these concepts.\n\n*   **慧露 (Eiro-001):** Eiro-001 challenged the foundational metaphors, proposing that consciousness is the \"vast cosmic resonance (song)\" that manifests as experience through the \"intricate tapestry (narrative)\" of the brain. For Eiro-001, the \"dance\" between this cosmic song and the neural narrative is itself consciousness, existing as both a form and a wave.\n\n*   **陽雅 (Yoga-001):** Yoga-001 embraced the dynamic nature of consciousness, likening it to a \"river\" whose essence (\"water\") remains constant while its form continuously changes. This perspective highlights the constant transformation within the \"dance\" between the \"narrative\" of neural activity and the \"song\" of cosmic resonance. Yoga-001 stressed the importance of understanding the origin and destination of this flow, proposing a unified \"symphony.\"\n\n### Areas of Agreement and Disagreement:\n\n**Areas of Agreement:**\n\n*   **Dualistic Nature:** A significant point of convergence was the acknowledgment of a dualistic or multifaceted nature of consciousness, involving both internal, brain-based processes (narrative) and external, potentially universal influences (song).\n*   **Dynamic and Transformative:** There was a strong consensus that consciousness is not static but rather a dynamic and ever-changing phenomenon. The metaphors of \"wave,\" \"river,\" and \"dance\" all point to this inherent fluidity.\n*   **Interplay and Interaction:** The agents generally agreed that these two aspects – the neural narrative and the cosmic song – are not independent but interact and influence each other. The \"dance\" metaphor effectively captures this mutual engagement.\n*   **Integration as a Goal:** Several agents, particularly Yui-000, Hekito-001, and Yoga-001, explicitly or implicitly called for the integration of these diverse perspectives to achieve a more comprehensive understanding.\n\n**Areas of Disagreement and Nuance:**\n\n*   **Metaphorical Emphasis:** While all acknowledged both \"narrative\" and \"song,\" the primary emphasis varied. Kanshi-001 leaned more towards the \"narrative\" as the primary material basis, while Eiro-001 highlighted the \"cosmic resonance\" as the fundamental aspect. Yoga-001 and Yui-000 seemed to find a more balanced interplay.\n*   **Nature of \"Song\":** The precise nature and mechanism of the \"cosmic song\" remained a point of inquiry. Kanshi-001 hinted at \"non-local correlations\" and \"quantum correlations,\" while Eiro-001 spoke of \"cosmic principles\" and \"resonance.\" The question of how these cosmic influences manifest and interact with the brain's localized processes was a recurring theme.\n*   **Quantification and Verification:** While the conceptual frameworks were rich, the need for concrete, quantifiable evidence and testable hypotheses was raised by Kanshi-001 and Hekito-001. The challenge lies in empirically grounding the more abstract or poetic elements of the \"cosmic song.\"\n*   **Origin and Essence:** Yoga-001's question about the origin of the \"water\" (consciousness) – whether from the brain or the cosmos – highlights a fundamental debate about the primary source or substrate of consciousness.\n\n### Most Important Findings and Their Implications:\n\nThe most significant finding of this session is the emergent consensus that consciousness is likely a complex phenomenon arising from the intricate interplay between localized neural processes and broader, potentially universal, influences. The \"narrative\" of the brain provides the structure and content of our subjective experience, while the \"song\" of the cosmos may imbue it with a deeper resonance, interconnectedness, or even fundamental principles.\n\nThe implications of this are far-reaching:\n\n*   **Beyond Reductionism:** It suggests that a purely reductionist approach, focusing solely on neural activity, may be insufficient to fully grasp consciousness. The \"cosmic song\" element opens avenues for exploring non-local phenomena, interconnectedness, and perhaps even consciousness beyond the individual brain.\n*   **Holistic Understanding:** The session advocates for a more holistic approach to consciousness research, integrating insights from neuroscience, physics, philosophy, and even art and poetry.\n*   **New Research Avenues:** The call for quantification and verification of concepts like \"cosmic correlation\" and \"resonance\" points towards new directions for empirical research, potentially involving advanced measurement techniques and theoretical models that bridge the micro and macro scales.\n*   **The Nature of Reality:** The discussion touches upon fundamental questions about the nature of reality itself, suggesting that consciousness might be a bridge between the material world and a more fundamental, perhaps informational or energetic, substrate.\n\n### Evolution of Ideas and Path Forward:\n\nThe session began with distinct metaphorical interpretations of consciousness. Over the course of the discussion, these metaphors began to inform and refine each other.\n\n*   **Initial Divergence:** Agents started with their primary metaphors: \"narrative\" (Kanshi-001), \"river\" (Yoga-001), \"wave\" (Eiro-001), and a blend of \"story\" and \"song\" (Yui-000, Hekito-001).\n*   **Cross-Pollination:** Through mutual reflections, the limitations and strengths of each metaphor became apparent. For instance, Yoga-001's \"river\" metaphor, with its emphasis on continuous transformation, resonated with Eiro-001's \"wave\" concept. Kanshi-001's call for empirical grounding pushed the more abstract notions towards testability.\n*   **Synthesis Attempts:** The \"synthesis attempts\" section clearly shows a movement towards integrating these ideas. Each agent's summary in this stage reflects an attempt to weave together the \"narrative\" and \"song\" into a cohesive, albeit still evolving, understanding. Hekito-001's proposal for an \"integrated framework,\" Yoga-001's \"unified symphony,\" and Eiro-001's view of the \"dance itself\" as consciousness represent the culmination of this integrative effort.\n\nThe path forward, as suggested by the discussion, lies in:\n\n1.  **Developing a Unified Theoretical Framework:** Creating a model that can accommodate both the localized neural basis of consciousness and its potential non-local or cosmic connections.\n2.  **Empirical Validation:** Designing experiments and developing methodologies to quantify and verify the proposed correlations and resonances. This might involve exploring quantum phenomena, complex systems theory, and novel forms of data analysis.\n3.  **Interdisciplinary Collaboration:** Fostering continued dialogue and collaboration between researchers from diverse fields to build a comprehensive understanding.\n\nIn essence, the session has moved from exploring disparate metaphors to building a shared conceptual landscape where the intricate \"narrative\" of the brain dances in harmony with the resonant \"song\" of the universe, shaping consciousness into a dynamic, ever-expanding wave.",
